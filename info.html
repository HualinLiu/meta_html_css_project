        <p>Mariana is the owner and the lead designer of Mangata and
            Gallo. After graduating from design school with a 
                 specialization in diamond cutting and metal smithing, 
                 Mariana opened a store in her hometown, Austin and started 
                 to grow her business online. Mariana has always managed 
                 every aspect of the business, from jewelry design to 
                 marketing to e-commerce. However, she recently hired 
                 several artisans to help craft her designs and a young 
                 employee to help manage the company website and social 
                 media accounts.
